/*
Operations: 
Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division. 

Addtiional operations we could add:
Squaring and square root 

How to implement:
Numbers from user to be stored into an array possibly
and we just add each element. 
So we would deal with the keyboard being a number input html. 
Maybe using the target values and manipulating them in some way.
